# Best Buy and Sell Price Finder

## Overview
This Python program finds out the best buy price and the best sell price from a list of stock prices to maximize profit.

## Problem Statement given by Purple Block
If this a list of prices [5,2,1,6,9,7] and you have to create a function which will give me the best buy price and the best sell prices (1 and 9) to maximise my profit.

## My Approach
The program uses a simple loop to iterate through the list of prices. It maintains two variables:
1. **Buy Price**: Tracks the lowest price.
2. **Sell Price**: Tracks the highest price.
**NOTE**: I didn't use in-built functions.

## Example
```
Input:
Enter a list of prices: 5 2 1 6 9 7
Output:
To get the maximum profit, below is the best buy price and sell price.
Buy Price = 1
Sell Price = 9
